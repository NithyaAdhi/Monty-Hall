# Monty-Hall
                                      Monty Hall Problem Simulation
A full-stack web application built with .NET and Angular to demonstrate and explore the famous Monty Hall probability problem. This project provides both a hands-on, playable game and a high-speed simulation engine to statistically prove the counter-intuitive results of the paradox.

üåü Key Features
Interactive Game Mode: Play the game yourself! Pick a door, have the host reveal a goat, and decide whether to switch or stay.
Statistical Simulation Engine: Run thousands of simulations in seconds on the backend to see the statistical advantage of switching doors.
Dynamic UI: The interface, built with Angular, provides real-time feedback and updates as you play.
Clean Client-Server Architecture: A clear separation of concerns with a .NET Web API handling the core logic and an Angular single-page application handling the user experience.
RESTful API: A well-defined API endpoint for the frontend to communicate with the backend simulation engine.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: C#, .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API
Frontend: Angular, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3
Tools: Visual Studio, VS Code, Git
